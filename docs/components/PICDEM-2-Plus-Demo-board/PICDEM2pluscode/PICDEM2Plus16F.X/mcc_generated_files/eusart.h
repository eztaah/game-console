  @File Name
    eusart.h

  @Summary
    This is the generated header file for the EUSART driver using MPLAB� Code Configurator

  @Description
    This header file provides APIs for driver for EUSART.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB� Code Configurator - v2.10.3
        Device            :  PIC16F1937
        Driver Version    :  2.00
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 v1.34
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 2.26
